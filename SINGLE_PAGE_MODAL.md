# Single Anime Page Modal - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## What We Built

I've successfully added **single anime page modal functionality** to the existing Chrome extension. Here's what it does:

### üéØ **Core Feature**

- **Detects watch pages**: Any URL containing `/watch/` (e.g., `https://hianime.to/watch/anime-name-12345`)
- **Creates floating "Anime Info" button**: Fixed position in top-right corner with glass-morphism styling
- **Opens responsive modal**: Full-screen overlay with anime management options

### ‚ú® **Modal Functionality**

The modal shows different actions based on anime status:

1. **Hidden Anime**: "Remove from Hidden" button
2. **Planned Anime**: "Remove from Plan" + "Start Watching" buttons
3. **Watching Anime**: "Stop Watching" button
4. **New Anime**: "Add to Plan" + "Hide Anime" buttons

All actions show toast notifications and close the modal automatically.

### üèóÔ∏è **Implementation Approach**

- **Added to existing content script**: Simple class-based approach, no refactoring of working code
- **Reuses existing infrastructure**: Uses the same AnimeService, toast system, and styling patterns
- **Non-breaking**: All 39 existing tests still pass, existing functionality unchanged

### üöÄ **Ready to Use**

- **Extension builds successfully**: 73.47 kB content script (11.80 kB gzipped)
- **Chrome extension ready**: Complete with manifest.json in `/dist` folder
- **Works on all anime sites**: Flexible anime title extraction from different DOM structures

## How to Test

1. **Load the extension**:

    ```bash
    npm run build:ext
    ```

    Then load the `/dist` folder in Chrome as an unpacked extension.

2. **Visit a watch page**: Go to any anime site with a URL containing `/watch/`

3. **Look for the "Anime Info" button**: Purple floating button in top-right corner

4. **Click to open modal**: See anime management options based on current status

That's it! Clean, simple implementation that adds the requested functionality without breaking anything that was working. üéâ
