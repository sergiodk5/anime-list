2. ✅ Achieve minimum 85% test coverage (GitHub Actions requirement)
3. ✅ Aim for 100% test coverage on new code
4. ✅ Pass all linting and formatting checks
5. ✅ Zero TypeScript compilation errors
6. ✅ All implemented features fully functional
7. ✅ Code review completed (if working in team)

#### 5. Escalation & Guidance Rule

**🆘 CRITICAL RULE**: If developer is stuck or struggling:

- **Iterations 1-5**: Attempt to solve using existing knowledge and documentation
- **After 5 iterations**: **MANDATORY web research phase**
- **Web Research Sources**: Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, official documentation, community forums
- **Document Research**: All sources consulted and solutions attempted
- **Time Limit**: Do not struggle alone for more than 2 hours total (including research)
- **Final Step**: If still stuck after web research, escalate to team lead

**When to Escalate**:

- Unable to achieve test coverage targets after web research
- Stuck on technical implementation for >2 hours (including research time)
- Facing architectural decisions beyond current knowledge
- Any blockers preventing sprint completion after web research
- Code quality issues that cannot be resolved with online resources

**How to Escalate**:

- Document the specific problem and all attempts made
- **Include web research summary**: URLs visited, solutions attempted from online sources
- Include error messages, code snippets, screenshots
- **List Stack Overflow/GitHub solutions tried**
- Specify what type of help is needed
- Schedule immediate session with team lead

**Team Lead Response**:

- Provide guidance within 4 hours of request
- Offer pair programming session if needed
- Help with architectural decisions
- Adjust scope if necessary to maintain quality

#### 6. Coverage Requirements

**GitHub Actions Integration**:

- **Minimum**: 85% coverage (CI/CD will fail below this)
- **Current Baseline**: 90.89% (as of July 2025)
- **Target**: 100% coverage for all new services and components
- **Command**: `npm run test:unit:coverage`
- **Verification**: Coverage report must be included in sprint report

**📌 Important Coverage Notes**:

- Current project already has **90.89% overall coverage**
- Developers should **NOT** be blamed for existing coverage gaps
- Focus on achieving **100% coverage for new import/export code**
- Do not decrease the current 90.89% baseline
- New features should maintain or improve overall project coverage

**Current Coverage Breakdown** (Baseline - July 2025):

```
File                          | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
All files                     |   90.89 |    87.07 |   98.47 |   90.89 |
commons/services              |   99.79 |    85.07 |     100 |   99.79 |

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GOVERNANCE ENFORCEMENT

### Sprint Reporting Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **MANDATORY STOPS**: Developers MUST stop after each sprint completion
2. **REPORT CREATION**: Sprint reports are required in `docs/import_export/reports/`
3. **NO BYPASS**: Cannot continue without explicit approval from team lead
4. **QUALITY GATES**: All technical requirements must be met

### GitHub Actions Integration

The CI/CD pipeline will enforce:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/import-export-feature.yml
- name: Test Coverage Check
  run: npm run test:unit:coverage
  # Will fail if coverage < 85%

- name: Code Quality Check
  run: |
      npm run lint
      npm run format:check
      npm run build
  # Will fail if any quality issues
```

### Approval Authority

**Team Lead Responsibilities**:

- Review sprint reports for completeness
- Verify test coverage meets requirements
- Ensure code quality standards maintained
- Approve/reject sprint progression
- Provide feedback for improvements

**Developer Responsibilities**:

- Stop immediately after sprint completion
- Create comprehensive sprint reports
- Achieve minimum 85% test coverage (aim for 100%)
- Fix all linting/formatting issues
- Wait for approval before proceeding
- **🔍 MANDATORY WEB RESEARCH**: Use online resources after 5 iterations on any problem
- **🆘 SEEK GUIDANCE**: Request help after web research if stuck >2 hours
- Document all guidance requests in sprint reports
- **Include web research summary** in all escalations

### Escalation Process

**For Quality Issues**:

1. **First Issue**: Provide specific feedback and rework timeline
2. **Second Issue**: Team lead intervention and additional mentoring
3. **Persistent Issues**: Consider team reassignment or project scope adjustment

**For Technical Blockers**:

1. **Immediate Response**: Team lead provides guidance within 4 hours
2. **Pair Programming**: Schedule session if complex architectural issues
3. **Scope Adjustment**: Modify sprint scope if necessary to maintain quality
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Document solutions for future reference
5. **Persistent Issues**: Consider team reassignment or project scope adjustment

This governance structure ensures high-quality deliverables while maintaining project timeline and technical standards.

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to delivering the import/export feature while maintaining high code quality and user experience standards. The two-developer team structure ensures proper knowledge transfer and code review, while the sprint-based approach allows for iterative development and early feedback.
