# Sprint Reports Directory

This directory contains mandatory sprint reports that developers must create after completing each sprint.

## Required Reports

- `developer_report_sprint1_export.md` - After Sprint 1 completion
- `developer_report_sprint2_import_infrastructure.md` - After Sprint 2 completion
- `developer_report_sprint3_import_ui.md` - After Sprint 3 completion
- `developer_report_sprint4_polish.md` - After Sprint 4 completion

## Governance Rules

1. **MANDATORY STOP**: Developers must stop after each sprint and create a report
2. **NO CONTINUATION**: Cannot proceed to next sprint without approval
3. **MINIMUM COVERAGE**: 85% test coverage required (GitHub Actions enforced)
4. **BASELINE COVERAGE**: Current project has 90.89% coverage - do not decrease this
5. **TARGET COVERAGE**: 100% test coverage on all new code
6. **QUALITY GATES**: All ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checks must pass
7. **SEEK GUIDANCE**: If stuck or struggling after multiple attempts, STOP and ask team lead for guidance immediately
8. **WEB RESEARCH MANDATORY**: After 5 iterations on any problem, developer MUST use web resources to find solutions

## Problem-Solving Process

**Research & Solution Finding**:

- **Iterations 1-5**: Attempt to solve the problem using existing knowledge and documentation
- **After 5 iterations**: MANDATORY web research phase
- **Search for**: Similar issues, Stack Overflow solutions, GitHub discussions, documentation
- **Document**: All research sources and solutions attempted
- **Apply**: Found solutions and adapt them to the current context
- **If still stuck after web research**: Then escalate to team lead with all research documented

## Coverage Expectations

**ðŸ“Œ Important**: The current project baseline is **90.89% coverage** (as of July 2025).

- Developers are **NOT** responsible for existing coverage gaps
- Focus on achieving **100% coverage for new import/export features**
- Do not decrease the current baseline coverage
- New code should maintain or improve overall project coverage

## Escalation Process

**When to Escalate**:

- Stuck on a technical problem for more than 2 hours
- Unable to achieve test coverage targets after multiple attempts
- Facing architectural decisions beyond current knowledge
- Any blockers preventing sprint completion
- **IMPORTANT**: Only after completing mandatory web research phase (after 5 iterations)

**How to Escalate**:

- Document the specific issue and attempts made (including web research)
- Include error messages, code snippets, or screenshots
- **List all web resources consulted** (Stack Overflow, GitHub, docs, etc.)
- **Summarize solutions attempted** from web research
- Request specific guidance or pair programming session
- Do not continue struggling in isolation

## Report Template
