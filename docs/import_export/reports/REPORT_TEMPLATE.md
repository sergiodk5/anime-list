### Test Coverage Details

**Current Project Baseline: 90.89%** (as of July 2025)

```
File                          | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s
------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
All files                     |   90.89 |    87.07 |   98.47 |   90.89 |
```

**New Coverage After Import/Export Implementation:**

```
File                    | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s
------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|------------------
ExportService.ts        |   100   |   100    |   100   |   100   |
ImportService.ts        |   100   |   100    |   100   |   100   |
PopupPage.vue           |   XX    |   XX     |   XX    |   XX    | {list lines if any}
```

**Note**: Developers should not be blamed for existing coverage gaps. Focus on achieving 100% coverage for new import/export code.
